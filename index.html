	<p><em><b>BENEFITS</b></em></p>
	<p align="center">After learning that Stanford athletes had been training barefoot, three of Nike's most innovative and creative employees <br> set out to  develop a shoe that felt natural and weightless, similar to bare feet. The team spent four years studying the <br> biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, <br> pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out.</p>
